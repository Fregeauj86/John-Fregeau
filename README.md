        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4'>About Me</h2>
        <p className='text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance with ambitions to advance my expertise through a PhD in Cyber Defense. Growing up surrounded by technology and inspired by my grandfather, I developed a passion for understanding complex systems and safeguarding them from emerging threats. I am eager to transition into the tech industry, leveraging my diverse background to make a meaningful impact. My experiences as an ESL teacher enhanced my communication skills and adaptability, while grading algebra tests for Pearson honed my analytical abilities and attention to detail. Working as a behavioral aide taught me patience, empathy, and effective teamwork. Additionally, my customer service role as a security officer helped me engage professionally with diverse individuals. My academic background in Math and Science (A.S.) and Biology (B.S.) provides a strong foundation for cybersecurity. I am also completing my CompTIA A+ certification through a rigorous program with Climb Hire and have earned certifications in IT Support, Digital Marketing, Ethical Hacking, and Responsive Web Design. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and passion for cybersecurity to contribute effectively in the tech industry.</p>
