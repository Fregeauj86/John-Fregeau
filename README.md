        <p className='text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, with ambitions to advance my expertise through a PhD in Cyber Defense. Growing up surrounded by technology, inspired by my grandfather, I developed a deep passion for understanding complex systems and safeguarding them from emerging threats. I am excited to transition into the tech industry, leveraging my diverse background to contribute effectively. My experiences as an ESL teacher, both overseas and online, honed my communication skills and adaptability, teaching students from various cultural backgrounds through digital platforms. My role in grading algebra tests for Pearson showcased my analytical skills and attention to detail, while working as a behavioral aide for students with autism cultivated patience, empathy, and the ability to collaborate with diverse teams. Additionally, my customer service experience as a security officer allowed me to engage professionally with individuals at all levels. My academic background, with an A.S. in Math and Science and a B.S. in Biology, provides a strong foundation for my transition into cybersecurity. I am also completing my CompTIA A+ certification through a rigorous 6-month program with Climb Hire and have earned certifications in IT Support, Digital Marketing, Ethical Hacking, and Responsive Web Design. I am eager to apply my technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and passion for cybersecurity to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
